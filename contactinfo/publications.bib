@article{Schmidt.2019b,
 abstract = {In plant breeding, heritability is often calculated (i) as a measure of precision of trials and/or (ii) to compute the response to selection. It is usually estimated on an entry-mean basis, since the phenotype is usually an aggregated value, as genotypes are replicated in trials, which stands in contrast with animal breeding and human genetics. When this was first proposed, assumptions such as balanced data and independent genotypic effects were made that are often violated in modern plant breeding trials/analyses. Due to this, multiple alternative methods have been proposed, aiming to generalize heritability on an entry-mean basis. In this study, we propose an extension of the concept for heritability on an entry-mean to an entry-difference basis, which allows for more detailed insight and is more meaningful in the context of selection in plant breeding, because the correlation among entry means can be accounted for. We show that under certain circumstances our method reduces to other popular generalized methods for heritability estimation on an entry-mean basis. The approach is exemplified via four examples that show different levels of complexity, where we compare six methods for heritability estimation on an entry-mean basis to our approach (example codes: https://github.com/PaulSchmidtGit/Heritability). Results suggest that heritability on an entry-difference basis is a well-suited alternative for obtaining an overall heritability estimate, and in addition provides one heritability per genotype as well as one per difference between genotypes.},

@article{Tulinska.2018,
 abstract = {The genetically modified maize event MON810 expresses a Bacillus thuringiensis-derived gene, which encodes the insecticidal protein Cry1Ab to control some lepidopteran insect pests such as the European corn borer. It has been claimed that the immune system may be affected following the oral/intragastric administration of the MON810 maize in various different animal species. In the frame of the EU-funded project GRACE, two 90-day feeding trials, the so-called studies D and E, were performed to analyze the humoral and cellular immune responses of male and female Wistar Han RCC rats fed the MON810 maize. A MON810 maize variety of Monsanto was used in the study D and a MON810 maize variety of Pioneer Hi-Bred was used in the study E. The total as well as the maize protein- and Cry1Ab-serum-specific IgG, IgM, IgA and IgE levels, the proliferative activity of the lymphocytes, the phagocytic activity of the granulocytes and monocytes, the respiratory burst of the phagocytes, a phenotypic analysis of spleen, thymus and lymph node cells as well as the in vitro production of cytokines by spleen cells were analyzed. No specific Cry1Ab immune response was observed in MON810 rats, and anti-maize protein antibody responses were similar in MON810 and control rats. Single parameters were sporadically altered in rats fed the MON810 maize when compared to control rats, but these alterations are considered to be of no immunotoxicological significance.},

@article{Schmidt.2017,
 abstract = {The data of four 90-day feeding trials and a 1-year feeding trial with the genetically modified (GM) maize MON810 in Wistar Han RCC rats performed in the frame of EU-funded project GRACE were analysed. Firstly, the data obtained from the groups having been fed the non-GM maize diets were combined to establish a historical control data set for Wistar Han RCC rats at the animal housing facility (Slovak Medical University, Bratislava, Slovakia). The variability of all parameters is described, and the reference values and ranges have been derived. Secondly, the consistency of statistically significant differences found in the five studies was analysed. In order to do so, the body weight development, organ weight, haematology and clinical biochemistry data were compared between the studies. Based on the historical control data, equivalence ranges for these parameters were defined, and the values measured in the GM maize-fed groups were compared with these equivalence ranges. Thirdly, the (statistical) power of these feeding studies with whole food/feed was assessed and detectable toxicologically relevant group differences were derived. Linear mixed models (LMM) were applied, and standardized effect sizes (SES) were calculated in order to compare different parameters as well as to provide an overall picture of group and study differences at a glance. The comparison of the five feeding trials showed a clear study effect in the control data. It also showed inconsistency both in the frequency of statistically significant differences and in the difference values between control and test groups.},

 abstract = {The GRACE (GMO Risk Assessment and Communication of Evidence; www.grace-fp7.eu ) project was funded by the European Commission within the 7th Framework Programme. A key objective of GRACE was to conduct 90-day animal feeding trials, animal studies with an extended time frame as well as analytical, in vitro and in silico studies on genetically modified (GM) maize in order to comparatively evaluate their use in GM plant risk assessment. In the present study, the results of a 1-year feeding trial with a GM maize MON810 variety, its near-isogenic non-GM comparator and an additional conventional maize variety are presented. The feeding trials were performed by taking into account the guidance for such studies published by the EFSA Scientific Committee in 2011 and the OECD Test Guideline 452. The results obtained show that the MON810 maize at a level of up to 33~{\%} in the diet did not induce adverse effects in male and female Wistar Han RCC rats after a chronic exposure.},
